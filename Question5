Question 5: Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and
multi-line comments.

Answer5:
Comments help developers understand and maintain code by adding explanations without affecting execution. They improve **readability, debugging, and collaboration**.  

1. **Single-line Comment** (`//`) – Used for short notes.  
   ```javascript
   // This is a single-line comment
   ```

2. **Multi-line Comment** (`/* ... */`) – Used for longer explanations.  
   ```javascript
   /* This is a 
      multi-line comment */
   ```
