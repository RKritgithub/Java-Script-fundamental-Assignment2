Question 6: Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript.
Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.

Answer6:

Using clear variable names improves **code readability, maintainability, and debugging**. It helps developers understand the purpose of variables without needing extra comments.  

 **Bad Naming:**  
```javascript
let x = 10;  
let y = 20;  
let z = x * y;  
```

**Good Naming:**  
```javascript
let width = 10;  
let height = 20;  
let area = width * height;  
```
