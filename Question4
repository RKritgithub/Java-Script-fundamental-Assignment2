Question 4: What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the
'let' keyword?

Answers:

Variables store and manage data in a program, making it dynamic and reusable. They help in:  
 **Storing values** (e.g., user input, calculations)  
 **Reusing data** throughout the script  
**Improving readability and maintainability**  

The `let` keyword allows declaring a variable that **can be updated but not re-declared** in the same scope.  

```javascript
let name = "Ravneet"; 
name = "Kaur"; // Allowed
```
